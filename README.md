# Romantic Birthday Website - Ready to Deploy

This package contains a single-page romantic birthday website you can personalize for 'Jass'.

## What you should replace
- `images/her1.jpg` and `images/her2.jpg` — replace these with the two photos of your girlfriend (keep filenames or update `index.html` accordingly).
- `audio/hbd.mp3` — replace with your chosen birthday song (same filename).
- Optional: `css/style.css` for color/font tweaks.

## Quick local preview
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click).  
   - Note: Autoplay policies may block music; use the "Play Music" button.

## Deploying (2 easy ways)

### GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Commit all files and push to GitHub.
3. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages → Source → choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder → Save.
4. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Netlify (free, easy)
1. Create a Netlify account.
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually" → drag & drop the unzipped folder.
3. Netlify will host it and give you a URL like `https://lovely-morse-1234.netlify.app/`.

## Security & Privacy
- This package does not contain your photos or music. Add them locally before deploying.
- Make sure you are okay with hosting personal photos publicly before publishing.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a GitHub-ready README and `CNAME` if you want a custom domain.
- Give exact Git commands to create the repo and push from your machine.
